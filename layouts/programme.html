The last word is never said.</p>

      <p>The non-narrative animated film is a poetic debate with the issue of "HOME" and the experience of the outland as a new home. A collage of fragments of Hilde Domin s poems and a concentration and overlay of sketchy drawings and sound elements - always incomplete, always close to disappearance. It describes the search for an inner place of calm - a timeless space of deceleration.</p>
