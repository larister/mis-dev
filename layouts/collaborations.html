      <p>The Brighton Film School is helping us put together the <a href="/competition">24 hour competition</a>. They have also generously contributed the £100 prize.</p>
      <h6><a href="http://www.iphone-movie-making.co.uk/index.php/about/">Bob Walters</a></h6>
      <p>Bob was the facilitator for the short film workshop at the Wallands School. He also put us in touch with the Brazilian School, <a href="http://www.acaia.org.br/">Instituto Acaia</a>.</p>
      <h6><a href="http://wallandsschool.org">The Wallands School, Lewes</a></h6>
      <p>The school took part in a one day filming and editing workshop, where 65 children created short films about ‘A day in my life in school’, depicting their experiences spending a day at The Wallands. Martin Blount, their Head of IT, helped us by having the iPads ready for the day. The films have a creative documentary style.</p>
      <h6><a href="http://www.acaia.org.br">Instituto Acaia, Brazil</a></h6>
      <p>The Instituto Acaia joined in with us creating short films with their students with the same topic as our local school: ‘A day in my life in school’. A wonderful example of cultural exchange.</p>
